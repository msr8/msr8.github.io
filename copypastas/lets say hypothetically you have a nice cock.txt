Let's say that, hypothetically you have a nice cock. hypothetically it has all the hallmarks of a "nice cock" now, let's say I examine your cock.

It has a nice shape, and mind you I have seen many cocks. Let's make a note of that, that this is a good shape for a cock to have. Now we go further into this hypothetical, you have nice shape, but what about length? Hypothetically, upon inspection of your cock, it would appear to be of adequate length, not too long, but not too short.

Now we have established that not only do you have a nice shape, but also nice length, it would also be assumed in this scenario that I have assessed your girth, but there is no need to as, hypothetically it was apparent that your girth was sufficient from the start.

So as I have assessed your cock, to summarise the assessment I shall rate it, in this situation, in theory it would be a 9.5/10, the only downside is that you're uncircumcised; I then, hypothetically end with this finishing statement: "Nice cock, good job king." To end, you in theory, have a nice cock and deserve a pat on the back, King.
