My school just banned relationships because “they are wrong”. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Sure they have caused some problems here like last week students were caught in the middle of the act during lunch break. A bit weird to do that in school but ok whatever. This week my school found out that one of the teachers was having a relationship with one of the students. I get that, that is wrong but why the hell are you banning me from dating students? I have only dated one girl before but when you ask her she denies it and prefers to call it “harassment” or some shit like that.

I wish I could go to a public school, homeschool sucks
