Hentai saved my life

I have always been a fan of porn but only started watching hentai around 2017. Started watching just a couple videos, created my collection then joined the most supportive and loving community I have ever seen.

Now I am a completely different person! Hentai motivated me to masturbate more (to cum faster) and today I can say I finally look like I have sex.

What a journey it's been. I'm so proud of this community, you shaped me (literally) to become who I am today.

Edit: all of these supportive responses and stories of similar experiences only validate my previous statement: this is the best community.
