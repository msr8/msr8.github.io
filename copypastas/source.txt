Source? Source? Source? Do you have a source on that? A source. I need a source. Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion. No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered. You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence. You still haven't provided me a valid source yet. Nope, still haven't. I just looked through all 56 thousand messages attatched to your user history, figures I'm debating a cheese supporter. A moron.
