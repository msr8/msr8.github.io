Thank you for posting it u/horabora2000. You are not only a great man but you're an honest one too. I was tired of the lies that people typed on the internet, it was quite saddening actually. I was about to beat my wife from anger but thanks to you she will live another day, I was quite doubtful when I saw your comment but, thankfully you did post it and you did not propagate terrible lies to the people of Reddit, the front page of the internet. I never knew a man like you could exist sir, but thanks to you, my faith in humanity has been restored. You see, I've seen a lot of bad things in my life that I won't get into since it makes me go into a rage but, you have made me a happy man again. I salute you, u/horabora2000. You are a great man and I hope you succeed in life.
