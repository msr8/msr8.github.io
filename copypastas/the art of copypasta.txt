The art of the copypasta is an ancient technique used by multiple generations across the world. It is a staple of mocking culture, a cornerstone. You're saying that, because "it's a secondhand insult, it does not affect me". Do I need to tell you how stupid that statement that is? Do you know how politicians get their votes halved? Exactly, by the media. "B-b-but how does the media do this?????" I hear you ask. Well, they use their own words against them. Just because you said something doesn't mean you are ''immune'' to any insult involved with that saying. Your pathetic little brain isn't able to even comprehend basic karma and I do not have a smidge of empathy for your inevitable failure in life. The author of a terribly written book is never immune to criticism. "Well, they spent a lot of time into writing the book so-" Shut Up. No. The mere cringe I experience when you speak using that voice of yours and its very own screeching nagging tone is close to infinite. The sheer inability of your mind to get a grasp of modern culture and society is a massive red flag involving all your future interactions with actually competent beings. I actively yearn for the day that your IQ surpasses 7 but alas, it'll sadly never happen.
