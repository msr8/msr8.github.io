Thankful to have you as a crewmate… but do you want to add a letter and become screwmates instead?

Hey, are you one of my tasks? Because I really want to do you.

Hey, are you a vent? Because I’m the imposter and I’d love to come in you.

I have a lot of tasks to complete still, but I’d love to do you first.

Hey, call me the MedBay… because I’d love to scan your body.

Figuring out the imposter is hard…. but I’ve got something harder.

I’m jealous of your hat… Because it gets to be on you.

Hey are you busy later? Because I’d love to explore your lower engine.

Hey, you’re done your tasks right? Wanna come explore my cockpit then?

If you’re the imposter, I’d love to be the vent… That way you can come inside me whenever you want.

Damn, I wish you were a task… Because I’d have no problem doing you and over and over.

Hey did you just kill me? Because I’ve got a big bone sticking out now…
