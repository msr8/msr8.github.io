For context, I (16M) am a white male who goes to a school (high school) with a black guy (17M). I think he (17M) is very ugly (because heâ€™s black), and yet he (17M) is constantly existing (living) near me (16M).

One day, he (17M) looked at me (16M), and that was the last straw. So the next day (last Tuesday), I (16M) brought a gun (3mm) to school (high school) and shot (murdered) him (17M), while shouting a racial slur (the n word) at the top of my (16M) lungs.

His (17M) friend (who is fat), a Mexican guy (16M), attempted to intervene (the murder), and save him (17M), but I (16M) called him (16M) a racial slur (the b word) as well as a homophobic slur (the f slur), because he (16M) was also gay (homosexual), along with being a minority (disgusting). I (16M) then shot him (16M), and he (16M) died (because he got shot), and now I wonder, am I the asshole for doing this?
