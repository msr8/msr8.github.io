I (M49) beat my wife (F14) the other day when she said Big Chungus wasn't that funny. I was watching big Chungus porn on reddit (wholesome 100) when my wife came in, begging to be released from my basement. I laughed in her face and told her no. Then I kept fapping to Chungus porn. She asked what I was watching, and I was in shock. How could this bitch not know what Big Chungus is? I got out the drawing board and explained all about Chungus lore. I showed her some Big Chungus memes and I started laughing hysterically at them. She looked weirded out and said Big Chungus wasn't that funny. Shock came over me. What was this bitch saying? I quickly lunged at her, impaling my fist into her face, breaking her nose and eye sockets. She screamed and howled in pain and cried. I kept beating her and yelling that Big Chungus was funny and if she didn't laugh at it I'd torture her in my dungeon. She screamed and cried until I knocked her out. I tied her to a chair in a soundproof room and locked the door. Now I sit here wondering, am I the asshole for doing that?
